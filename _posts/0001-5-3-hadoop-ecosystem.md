* the term “Hadoop” has evolved to describe an ecosystem of tools
	1. **[HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/)** column-oriented database that supports large tables
	2. **[Hive](http://hive.apache.org/)** data warehouse with SQL like ad-hoc querying and data summarization
	3. **[Pig](http://pig.apache.org/)** data-flow language and execution framework for parallel computation
	4. **[Flume](http://flume.apache.org)** collect and aggregate large amounts of log data
* Ecosystem applications are higher level tools that work on top of HDFS and MapReduce
