* Google File System (GFS) is a distributed file system
* shares the same goals as other distributed file systems: performance, scalability, reliability, and availability
* design differences driven by observations of Google's application workloads and technological environment
	* high component failure rates
	* large multi gigabyte files, and multi terabyte datasets
	* file mutation by appending to, not overwriting existing data
* operations: create, delete, open, close, read, write, snapshot, append
