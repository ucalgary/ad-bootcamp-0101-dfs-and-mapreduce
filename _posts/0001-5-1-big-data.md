* three major aspects of Big Data
	1. **velocity**: Data is coming in at an ever increasing rate. Twitter processes over 400 million (12 TB) tweets every day. The Large Hadron Collider generates data at 40 TB per second.
	2. **volume**: Data is increasing rapidly in amount. US utility companies record 350 billion meter readings per year. 	
	3. **variety**: Data may be structure or unstructured, and come in many forms such as web pages, sensor data, audio and video, application logs, and more.
